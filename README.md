# OVERVIEW

Biber is a BibTeX replacement for users of biblatex, with full Unicode
support.

**Please note**--the default download for all platforms is 64-bit. Please
look in the files section for the correct 32-bit platform instead of
using the default download button if you want 32-bit.

## REQUIREMENTS

Biber is written in Perl with the aim of providing a customised and
sophisticated data preparation backend for biblatex.

You do not need to install Perl use biber--binaries are provided for many
operating systems via the main TeX distributions (TeXLive, MacTeX, MiKTeX)
and also via download from SourceForge.

You only need a Perl installation to use biber in one of the following
cases:

- A binary version is not available for your OS/platform
- You wish to keep up with all of the bleeding-edge git commits before they
- are packaged into a binary.

For the vast majority of users, using the latest binary for the OS/platform
you are using will be what you want to do. For details on the requirements
for installing the Perl program version, please see the biber PDF documentation.

The git repository for Biber is kept on github:

## SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION

After installing, `biber --help` will give you the basic documentation.

The latest PDF documentation can be found here:

[https://sourceforge.net/projects/biblatex-biber/files/biblatex-biber](https://sourceforge.net/projects/biblatex-biber/files/biblatex-biber)

More information, bugfix releases, forums and bug tracker are available at:

## BUILDING

If you wish to build you own binary, see the main biber PDF documentation.
There is a section there on how to do this. The PDF documentation is in the
`documentation` folder for the release on Sourceforge.
